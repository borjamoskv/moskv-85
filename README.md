### 1. Introduction

MOSKV-85 is a stack-based, Turing-complete virtual machine and esoteric programming language designed to operate over the 85 printable ASCII characters from code 33 (character "!") to 117 (character "u"). Any character outside of this alphabet is treated as whitespace or ignored (acting as comments), except when enclosed inside string literal blocks or comments.

**Anergy Purge Engine (AOT Lexer):** To maximize thermodynamic execution efficiency (exergy), MOSKV-85 includes a pre-JIT compilation layer. Before execution, the engine purges all non-essential entropy (whitespace, ignored characters, and inline comments) directly from the instruction stream, guaranteeing that `while` loops (`f`) and code blocks (`e`) execute with O(1) fetching latency, without redundant context parsing.

### 2. Base-85 Alphabet Mapping

The alphabet contains exactly 85 characters, ordered by ASCII code:
`!"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstu`

Each character maps to a digit value from 0 to 84:
- "!" = 0
- "\"" = 1
- "#" = 2
- ...
- "u" = 84

### 3. Literals & Constants

MOSKV-85 supports direct integer pushing, 32-bit/64-bit Base-85 literals, and fast built-in constants.

- **Direct digits:** "0" to "9" push the corresponding integer values 0 to 9 directly onto the stack.
- **32-bit Literals:** The prefix "#" reads the next 5 characters, decodes them from Base-85 as a 32-bit unsigned value, converts it to a signed 32-bit integer, and pushes it onto the stack.
- **64-bit Literals:** The prefix "$" reads the next 10 characters, decodes them from Base-85 as a 64-bit unsigned value, converts it to a signed 64-bit integer, and pushes it onto the stack.
- **Built-in constants:**
  - "(" pushes -1.
  - ")" pushes 255 (byte mask).
  - "F" pushes 0 (False).
  - "O" pushes 1 (True).
  - "T" pushes 2 (Two).
  - "H" pushes 100.
  - "K" pushes 1000.
  - "P" pushes 314159 (approximated Pi).
  - "k" pushes the Creator magic constant (858585).
  - "V" pushes the MOSKV-85 version identifier (85).

### 5. Execution Model

- **Comments:** The backtick character (`` ` ``) comments out the rest of the line. Any non-alphabet character in regular code blocks is silently ignored.
- **Strings:** Double backslashes (like `\text\`) represent string constants. When parsed, the string is pushed to the stack as a unified String object.
- **Blocks:** Square brackets `[ ... ]` group code as data (blocks). A block is pushed onto the stack as a string containing its code.
- **While Loops:** The `f` instruction popped a conditional block and a body block. It runs the conditional block, pops the top of the stack, and if it is non-zero, runs the body block, repeating the cycle.
- **Conditionals:** The `t` instruction pops a condition and a block, executing it if the condition is non-zero. The `j` instruction pops a condition, a false block, and a true block, executing the corresponding block.

### 6. Usage and Execution

To run a MOSKV-85 file, execute:
```bash
python3 moskv85.py <file.m85>
```

To run with final debug information (dumps stack and memory at halt):
```bash
python3 moskv85.py -d <file.m85>
```

To encode numbers to Base-85 representation:
```bash
python3 helper.py <integer_value> [width=5/10]
```
